# If you're curious about the person behind this website, you're in the right place. Let me share my journey - a path that has shaped my passions and ambitions.
tag: introduction

From a young age, computers weren't just gadgets to me; yes, I loved gaming but they were also something I enjoyed with passion. Growing up, I was that kid in elementary school who fixed classmates' tech issues and tinkered with basic programming. I spent hours immersed in video games, but what truly got me hooked at first, was understanding how they work, and how to make them. My early projects in Scratch and Clickteam Fusion 2.5 were simple, but they sparked a deep curiosity about code and logic behind games. Unfortunately, those early projects of mine are now lost media, but they were the foundation of my childhood curiousity towards computers and technology.

In technical school, I naturally majored in IT with a focus on game development (yes this was an actual subject). It was a great choice, because I was able to improve in general basic tech stuff like computer hardware, networks, peripherals, databases etc. but also grow in my passion which was game development. However, the program took an unexpected turn when game development classes were abruptly dropped due to the lack of teachers, which is all too common in educational system, especially in Poland. Despite this setback, I remained hooked on the principles of game design until my third year. That's when I participated in "praktyki wewnƒôtrzne," Poland's in-school internship program, where students had 3 months to tackle real-world tech projects, be it a RaspberryPi Wi-Fi scanner, or a video game. I dove into creating a top-down adventure game in Godot centered on our school - I even had a friend who was a lead pixel artist! It helped me a lot. It was a hands-on lesson in project management and iteration, teaching me the value of persistence. As I finished the project and my third school year ended, my interests pivoted toward web development. Alas, that phase also hit roadblocks due to me not being exactly sure if that is the career path for me.

Choosing a career path has been full of those internal battles - I think it's a pretty common thing in tech, where the endless options can just feel overwhelming. I used to wrestle with the idea of trying to master everything, like websites, mobile and desktop apps, or even hardware tinkering. But through a lot of trial and error - jumping from one thing to another - I finally realized that true fulfillment comes from diving deep into a few areas instead of spreading myself everywhere like a butter on toast. Now, I've narrowed it down to what really excites me: network engineering, cybersecurity, and maybe some IoT. It's such a relief to finally have that clarity, and I'm pumped to explore the nitty-gritty!
