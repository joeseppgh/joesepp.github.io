hello world, notepad games

### > whoami
My name is Mark, on the interwebs known as Joesepp :) I was born 20 years ago in a small town in Ukraine üá∫üá¶ (as of now, I live in Poland üáµüá± and am a Polish citizen)

### Early Years

Let's start with when I got to use a computer for the first time. When I was about 4 years, my dad bought a PC for our family, for general use. I remember playing browser games and having fun a lot of fun :) When I got older (10 years old?), computers stopped being just gadgets to me that I used for gaming and surfing the internet, I actually started being passionate about them and the IT & CS sectors in general. I then got into very simple programming in notepad using batch language, and then converting ```.txt``` files to ```.bat``` to run them. I made very simple games like linear adventure game with decisions. The entire file was basically filled with ```if``` statements, but as a child, I had a lot of fun.

When I was about 11 or 12, my IT class teacher in elementary school, taught us <b>Scratch</b> and <b>turtle.py</b> I then proceeded create simple games and drawing scripts, which brought me even more fun than notepad scripting! This was also the time when I discovered a game engine called <b>Clickteam Fusion 2.5</b> <sup>(fun fact: first FNAF was made in this)</sup>. I spent a few days learning this engine and then created two projects: a clone of <a href="https://januszsimulator.en.aptoide.com/app" target="_blank">Janusz Simulator</a> (it seems like it was deleted from the Play Store so here's an Aptoide link) and a Zombie Survival Platformer.

In my elementary school years, I also was <b>the</b> IT guy that fixed classmates' tech issues and helped with IT class assignments.

### Technical School

In technical school I, naturally, chose to major in IT with a focus on game development (yes this was an actual subject). It was a great choice, because I was able to improve in general basic tech stuff like computer hardware, networks, peripherals, databases etc. but also grow in my passion which was game development. However, the program took an unexpected turn when game development classes were abruptly dropped due to the lack of teachers, which is all too common in educational system, especially in Poland. Despite this complication, I remained hooked on the principles of game design until my third year. That's when I participated in "praktyki wewnƒôtrzne," Poland's in-school internship program, where students had 3 months to tackle real-world tech projects, be it a RaspberryPi Wi-Fi scanner, or a video game. I dove into creating a top-down adventure game in Godot centered around our school - I even had a friend who was a lead pixel artist! It helped me a lot. It was a hands-on lesson in project management, teaching me the value of persistence.

As I finished the project and my third school year ended, my interest for game dev ended with it. The last about two years of tech school I pivoted towards full-stack web-app development. I liked that it had both creative and non-creative sides to it. But that was about it. I seemed to like and understand it, but I didn't really feel like it is an optimal career path for me, you know?

### Where I am now

So I finished tech school, wrote matura exam, and now what? I didn't know what to do. Those past five years I spent in tech school I learned stuff only in school, and basically wasted a lot of my free time on gaming and wants. So I started feeling like a piece of shit, because I felt like I know nothing. So I spent a few months on reflecting on myself, experimenting, and trying to get and answer to what I want to do career-wise, I was full of internal battles. Endless options of career paths felt super overwhelming. I used to wrestle with the idea of trying to master everything, like websites, mobile and desktop apps, or even hardware tinkering. But through a lot of trial and error - jumping from one thing to another - I finally got my answer. I finally realized that true fulfillment comes from diving deep into a few areas instead of spreading myself everywhere like a butter on toast. I understood that things that really excite me, that I get real happiness from is <i>operating systems (like troubleshooting issues)</i>, <i>network engineering (you know, routers and stuff)</i>, <i>cybersecurity</i>, and maybe even some <i>IoT</i> and <i>DevOps</i>. It's such a relief to finally have that clarity.

And now here I am. For now I am enjoying vacations. What will I be doing in the future? Time will tell, but we'll where my plans and ambitions will carry me.
